test: icudp/icudp_full_high_drop_rate

# This test relies on some mechanism to simulate network package dropping,
# we used to do this with the help of a customized kernel module, but that is
# retired as it requires superuser privilege and does not work in containers.
# Until we have a better solution please do not enable this test.
